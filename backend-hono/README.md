# Hono Boilerplate with Authentication

This is a starter kit for building web applications using [Hono](https://hono.dev/), a small, fast, and standalone web framework for Cloudflare Workers, Deno, Bun, Node.js, and more. This boilerplate comes pre-configured with basic user authentication to help you get up and running quickly with secure applications.

## Features

* **Hono:** A lightweight and efficient web framework.
* **Basic User Authentication:** Includes user registration and login functionalities.
* **Middleware:** Demonstrates the use of middleware for authentication and potentially other tasks.
* **Simple Routing:** Clear and organized route definitions.
* **Environment Variable Configuration:** Uses `.env` files for managing sensitive information.
* **Developer Experience:** Designed for a smooth development workflow.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the `.env.example` file.
    * Set necessary environment variables, such as database connection strings, secret keys for JWT (if used), etc.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  **Open in your browser:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Authentication Details

This boilerplate provides a basic authentication system. You'll typically find the following functionalities:

* **User Registration:** An endpoint for creating new user accounts.
* **User Login:** An endpoint for authenticating existing users and obtaining an access token (e.g., JWT).
* **Protected Routes:** Middleware to secure specific routes, requiring a valid authentication token to access.

**Note:** The specific implementation details of the authentication (e.g., database used, password hashing algorithm, token format) will depend on the choices made in the boilerplate. Refer to the code in the `routes` and `middleware` directories for the exact implementation.
